# Unit test generation instructions
- Use a separate test file for the tests of each source file
- Name the test files with the same name as the source files, but with a `.test.ts` suffix
- Use the `src/test/unit` directory for unit tests
- Use TypeScript for writing tests
- Use the `mocha` test framework
- Use tdd (test-driven development) style for writing tests
- Create a separate suite to group the tests of each function
- For a class, create a separate suite to group the tests of each member
- Put the test suites in the test file in the same order as the corresponding functions in the source file
- Use '<name> tests' as the title of the suite, where `<name>` is the name of the function being tested
